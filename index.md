### whoami

Hello, I'm a generalist with interests in data engineering, cloud engineering, linux and software engineering. Currently, I work as a **Data Engineer II** in Amazon's FinTech team.

On this little corner of the internet, I occasionally write down my thoughts and learning on topics that spark my interest—be it tech, data, or anything that I'm learning.

When I’m not immersed in tech, you’ll find me getting lost in the soul-crushing riffs and guttural growls of my favourite death and doom metal bands.

You can read more [about me here](https://jithendray.github.io/about). I write [notes](https://jithendray.github.io/notes), occasionally [blog](https://jithendray.github.io/blog) and share some of my [miscellaneous favorite things](https://jithendray.github.io/misc). Curious about what I’m up to? Check out my [now page](https://jithendray.github.io/now).
