I'm passionate about bridging the gap between software engineering and data analytics. The fusion of these fields excites me as it enables one to build robust, scalable systems that handle vast amounts of data with efficiency and precision.

#### A few more things about me
- I grew up in [Eluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluru), a simple little town in Andhra Pradesh, India.
- I live by the timeless Stoic principle, 'Memento Mori'—remember, you must die. This encourages me to remember that tomorrow is not promised, live now, embrace the temporality of it all.
- I’m a metalhead who finds solace in doom and death metal, and I’m always up for a good horror movie marathon.
- Philosophy books are my go-to reads, especially those that dive into the depths of human nature and existential questions. Right now, I’m reading works by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
- The name of my cat <a href="/images/judas-2.jpg">Judas</a>, is inspired from my favorite song —"[Kiss of Judas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaatBMAAt_Y)", and one of my favorite bands —"[Judas Priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest)".
