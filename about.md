Hello, my name is Jithendra Yenugula.

I currently work as a **Data Engineer II** at Amazon in the FinTech team. As a programmer, I code mostly in Python. I’m an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect and Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer.

When I’m not in the tech zone, you’ll likely find me absorbed in the bone-crushing riffs and soul-piercing growls of my favorite death and doom metal bands.

**A few more things about me**
- **Hometown**: I grew up in [Eluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluru), a small, peaceful town in Andhra Pradesh, India.
- **Philosophy**: I live by the Stoic principle _Memento Mori_—"remember, you must die." It encourages me to remember that tomorrow is not promised, live now, embrace the temporality of it all.
- **Music**: I’m a metalhead who loves doom and death metal.
- **Movies**: Horror is my favorite genre, and I never say no to a good horror movie marathon.
- **Books**: I enjoy philosophy and existential literature. These days, I’m trying to dive into the works of **Fyodor Dostoevsky**.
- **My Cat**: Meet <a href="/images/judas-2.jpg">**Judas**</a>, my furry companion, named after one of my favourite songs, _Kiss of Judas_, and my love for **Judas Priest**.
