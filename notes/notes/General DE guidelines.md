## 1. Code Readability and Structure

### 1.1 Follow PEP 8 Standards (High Priority)
PEP 8 is the official Python style guide, and it provides conventions for writing readable and consistent code. Some key rules include:
	- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions, `CamelCase` for class names.
- [Google Style Guides | styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
  
**Example:**
```python
def extract_data_from_s3(bucket_name, file_key):
    # Fetch data from S3 bucket
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
    return response['Body'].read()
```

### 1.2 Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names (High Priority)
Your function and variable names should describe their purpose clearly. Avoid short or ambiguous names like `a`, `b`, or `func`.

**Example:**
```python
# Bad:
def f(data):
    pass

# Good:
def transform_customer_data(customer_data):
    pass
```

### 1.3 Modular Code Design (High Priority)
Create well-structured, modular code by dividing large tasks into smaller, single-purpose functions. Each function should be responsible for a single task or operation, making the code more readable, reusable, maintainable, and easier to test.

**Single-Responsibility Principle**:
- **One Task per Function**: Each function should perform only one specific task. For example, a function to fetch data from an API should not also process or save the data; instead, these tasks should be handled by separate functions.
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names that reflect the function's purpose, which makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand.

**DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**:
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Refactor common logic into reusable functions instead of duplicating code. For instance, if multiple parts of the application perform data validation, consolidate these checks into a single validation module or function.
- **Parameterized Functions**: Use parameters to make functions flexible and adaptable to different contexts without modifying the underlying code.

**Example:**
```python
def extract_data():
    pass

def transform_data(data):
    pass

def load_data(transformed_data):
    pass
```

## 2. Error Handling and Logging

### 2.1 Implement Robust Error Handling (High Priority)
Ensure that code gracefully handles potential failures, particularly in operations prone to issues, such as external API calls, file reads/writes, and database transactions. By implementing robust error handling, you can prevent unexpected crashes, facilitate debugging, and improve system resilience.

**Use `try-except` Blocks for Critical Code**:
- **Wrap External Calls**: Surround external API requests, file I/O, and database queries with `try-except` blocks to handle issues such as network timeouts, permission errors, or resource unavailability.
- **Specific Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `ConnectionError`) rather than using broad `except` statements, as this helps to manage known error types appropriately and avoid masking other issues.

**Avoid Silent Failures**:
- **Log, Don’t Suppress**: Instead of suppressing exceptions (e.g., using a bare `except` block), log the error with sufficient detail. Suppressing errors silently can obscure issues, making them harder to detect and resolve.
- **Conditional Handling**: Only suppress specific errors if they’re non-critical or expected (e.g., handling file-not-found errors gracefully if a missing file is non-essential).

**Retry Logic for Recoverable Failures**:
- **Transient Errors**: For external services or database connections that may fail temporarily, implement retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff). This gives operations a chance to succeed after transient issues.
- **Retries with Limits**: Set a maximum retry limit to prevent infinite loops in case of persistent failures.
```python
import time
import requests

max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
        response.raise_for_status()
        break  # Exit loop if successful
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
else:
    print("Max retries reached. Exiting...")
```

**Graceful Error Responses**:
- **Return Meaningful Messages**: When errors occur, return meaningful messages to users or calling functions instead of generic ones. This makes it clear what went wrong without exposing sensitive information.
- **Fallbacks and Defaults**: Provide fallback mechanisms if possible (e.g., default values, cached data) to allow the application to proceed in a limited capacity when errors occur.


**Example:**
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def extract_data():
    try:
        # Simulating an external API call that may fail
        response = call_api()
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Data extraction failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### 2.2 Logging with Contextual Information (Medium Priority)
Log important events, errors, and data processing steps using the `logging` module. Include contextual information in log messages to make debugging easier.

**Example:**
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def transform_data(data):
    try:
        # Transformation logic
        transformed_data = data.lower()
        logging.info("Data successfully transformed.")
        return transformed_data
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error transforming data: {e}")
        raise
```

## 3. Data Validation and Testing

### 3.1 Perform Data Validation at Every Step (High Priority)
Validate your data during the extraction, transformation, and loading stages. Ensure that incoming data is not corrupt or missing important fields.

**Validation During Extraction:**
- Format Checks: Verify that the data format matches the expected structure (e.g., CSV, JSON schema). For example, if extracting a CSV, check that each row has the correct number of columns.
- Field Presence: Ensure that all required fields are present and not null. This is especially important when extracting data from APIs or files where fields may occasionally be missing or blank.
- Type Checks: Validate data types for each field (e.g., ensure that a date field is in the correct format or a numeric field contains only numbers).

**Validation During Transformation:**
- Range and Value Checks: Verify that values fall within expected ranges (e.g., a temperature value should not be negative in specific contexts, and dates should be within a reasonable time frame).
- Consistency Checks: Validate that data relationships are preserved (e.g., foreign key constraints, referential integrity). For instance, if a transaction record refers to a customer ID, that ID should exist in the customer dataset.
- Business Rules Validation: Apply business-specific validation logic. For example, in a financial dataset, ensure that debit and credit totals are balanced.
- Null and Missing Value Checks: Identify and handle null or missing values based on business rules (e.g., imputing values, flagging records, or discarding incomplete data).

**Validation During Loading:**
- Data Completeness Checks: Verify that all expected data has been loaded successfully. Compare record counts between the source and target to ensure there are no losses during loading.
- Schema Compliance: Ensure that data conforms to the target database schema, especially if it involves strict data types or constraints.
- Duplicate Detection: Identify and handle duplicate records in the target database to avoid redundant data entries. For example, use unique constraints or deduplication logic as appropriate.
**Automated Alerts and Logging**:
- Alerting: Set up alerts for validation failures at each ETL stage. For example, if missing fields are detected during extraction, send an alert for immediate review.
- Logging: Maintain detailed logs of validation errors, including data values and failure types, to facilitate tracking and debugging.

**Testing and Continuous Improvement**:
- Automated Tests: Implement automated tests to validate data quality checks during ETL development.
- Feedback Loops: Establish feedback loops to refine validation rules over time as data requirements evolve or new data sources are integrated.

**Example:**
```python
def validate_data(data):
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Data is empty")
    if 'id' not in data:
        raise KeyError("Missing 'id' in data")
```

### 3.2 Use Unit Tests for Key Functions (Medium Priority)
Write unit tests for critical ETL functions to ensure correctness. Use the `unittest` or `pytest` libraries to automate testing.

**Example using pytest:**
```python
import pytest

def test_transform_data():
    raw_data = "Hello"
    result = transform_data(raw_data)
    assert result == "hello"
```

## 4. Parameterization and Configuration Management

### 4.1 Avoid Hard-Coded Values (High Priority)
Move configuration values (e.g., file paths, database credentials, API keys) to external configuration files like `.yaml`, `.json`, or environment variables. This allows the code to be more flexible and secure.
- Use Configuration Files: Store non-sensitive values like file paths, API URLs, and other parameters in configuration files. For example, .yaml or .json files can contain paths and general settings, while sensitive data should be managed separately.
- Environment Variables for Sensitive Data: Store sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, in environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service. This keeps them secure and allows access control.
- Use a Configuration Loader: Use a library or utility in your code to load configuration values from files or environment variables. For example, in Python, libraries like pyyaml or json can load settings from files, while os.environ can be used to access environment variables.
- Automate Config Management: If using cloud services, integrate secrets management solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault) to automatically retrieve sensitive configurations. This approach further improves security and enables seamless configuration management.
- Document Configuration Requirements: Ensure that all team members are aware of the required environment variables and configuration files by maintaining a setup guide or using sample configuration files (e.g., config.example.yaml) that document each required setting.

**Example of a YAML config:**
```yaml
aws:
  s3_bucket: "my-data-bucket"
  file_key: "data/file.csv"
```

**Example of loading the YAML config:**
```python
import yaml

def load_config(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as config_file:
        return yaml.safe_load(config_file)

config = load_config('config.yaml')
```

### 4.2 Use Environment Variables or Secrets Manager for Sensitive Information (High Priority)
Never hard-code sensitive information like database passwords or API keys. Use environment variables and libraries like `os` to access them securely.

**Example:**
```python
import os

DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
```

## 5. Documentation and Readability

### 5.1 Write Clear Docstrings (Medium Priority)
Provide clear docstrings for all functions and classes, describing the purpose, input arguments, and return values.

**Example:**
```python
def extract_data_from_s3(bucket_name, file_key):
    """
    Extracts data from the specified S3 bucket and file.

    Args:
        bucket_name (str): Name of the S3 bucket.
        file_key (str): Key of the file to extract.

    Returns:
        str: Content of the file as a string.
    """
    pass
```



## 7. Code Maintenance and Version Control

### 7.1 Use Version Control (High Priority)
Ensure all code is version-controlled using **Git**. Use branches for new features and pull requests to review and approve changes.

### 7.2 Linting and Code Formatting (Medium Priority)
Use tools like **flake8** and **black** to lint and auto-format your code. These tools help ensure consistent code style across the team.
