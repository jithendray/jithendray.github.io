**Financial Accounting:** The process of identifying, recording, summarising and analysing an entity's financial transactions and reporting them in financial statements

- Core principle of Financial accounting -> Stuff that a business owns = Stuff that a business owes 
- Accounting Equation
	- ASSETS = LIABILITIES (for 3rd parties) + EQUITY (for owners)

Accounting Cycle:
- Step 1: Identifying transactions
- Step 2: Journal entry
- Step 3: Post to General Ledger
	- General Ledger - A database that stores a complete record of accounts & journal entries
	- account = a place where we record, sort and store all financial transactions that affect a related group of items
	- 6 types of accounts 
		- assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, dividends
- Step 4: Put together unaccounted TRIAL BALANCE
	- TRIAL BALANCE = an accounting report showing the closing balances of all general ledger accounts
- Step 5: Adjusting entries
	- journal entries posted at the end of an accounting period to bring a business's book in line with the accrual method of accounting
- Step 6: Adjusted Trial Balance
- Step 7: Create Financial Statements
- Step 8: Post closing entries
