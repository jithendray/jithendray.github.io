The following questions are generated using chatGPT. If I thoroughly practice these questions, covering the broad range of topics, it should be sufficient for building a strong foundation for SQL interviews. However, to ensure I am fully prepared for a variety of question styles, it would still be beneficial to practice more problems from sites like leetcode, stratascratch and data lemur.

### 1. **Basic Querying (CRUD Operations)**

**Tables:**
- `Employees`: (id, name, age, department_id, salary)
- `Departments`: (id, department_name)
#### Easy:
1. Retrieve the names and ages of all employees from the `Employees` table.
```sql
select name, age from Employees
```

2. Find the department names where employees have a salary greater than 50,000.
```sql
select distinct d.department_name
from Employees e join Departments d
on e.department_id = d.id
where e.salary > 50000
```

#### Medium:
1. Find the number of employees in each department.
```sql
   select d.department_name, count(distinct e.id) as cnt
   from Employees e left join Departments d
   on e.department_id = d.id
   group by d.department_name
```
2. Update the salary of employees in the "Finance" department by increasing it by 10%.
```sql
   update Employees e
   set e.salary = e.salary + 0.1 * e.salary
   from Departments d
   where e.department_id = d.id
   and d.department_name = 'Finance'
```
3. Delete all employees from the `Employees` table who are younger than 25.
```sql
   delete from Employees
   where age < 25
```

#### Hard:
1. Write a query to retrieve the top 5 highest-paid employees in each department.
```sql
   select department_id, name
   from (select department_id, name, 
   rank() over (partition by department_id order by salary desc) as rnk
   from Employees) as ranked_employees
   where rnk <6;
```

2. Insert a new employee into the `Employees` table, ensuring the department exists in the `Departments` table. Use transactions to ensure data integrity.
```sql
   begin;
   
   if exists (select 1 from Departments where id = :dep_id:)
   then
   insert into Employees (name, age, salary, department_id)
   values (:name:, :age:, :salary:, :dep_id:);
   
   commit;
   
   else
   rollback;
   raise notice 'department id % does not exist, employee not added', :dep_id:;
   
   end if;
```

3. Find the name of the department with the highest total employee salary.
```sql
   select dep.name
   from (
	   select department_id, sum(salary) as total_salary,
	   rank() over (order by sum(salary) desc) as rnk
	   from Employees
	   group by department_id
   ) as dept_salaries
   join Departments dep
   on dept_salaries.department_id = dep.id
   where rnk = 1
```

### 2. **Joins**

**Tables:**

- `Orders`: (order_id, customer_id, order_date, amount)
- `Customers`: (customer_id, customer_name, customer_address)

#### Easy:

1. Retrieve all orders along with the customer names.
```sql
select c.customer_name, o.order_id
from Orders o
left join Customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
```
2. Find the total amount of all orders placed by each customer.
```sql
select c.customer_name, sum(o.amount) as total_amount
from Orders o
left join Customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
group by c.customer_name;
```

#### Medium:

1. List all customers who have not placed any orders.
```sql
select distinct c.customer_name
from Orders o
right join Customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where order_id is null
```
2. Write a query to find customers who placed more than 5 orders in the last 6 months.
```sql
select c.customer_name

group by c.customer_id
having count(order_id) > 5
```
3. Retrieve the customer names and their order amounts for orders that exceed $500.
```sql
select c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
from Orders o
join Customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where o.amount > 500
```
 note: using left join - VALID - if you want to include customers with no orders; however, it will still return NULL values for amount in those cases. use INNER JOIN to only retrieve customers who have placed orders exceeding $500
#### Hard:

1. Find the top 3 customers based on the total value of their orders, but only for orders placed in 2023.
```sql

left join Customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where extract(year from o.order_date) = 2023
group by c.customer_name
),
ranked_customers as (select customer_name, total_amount,
	rank() over (order by total_amount desc) as rnk
)
select customer_name
from ranked_customers
where rnk <= 3;
```
2. Write a query to find customers who placed their first order in 2023 and then placed an additional order within the next 30 days.
```sql
with first_orders as (
	select customer_id, min(order_date) as first_order_date
	from Orders
	group by customer_id
	having min(order_date) >= '2023-01-01' and min(order_date) < '2024-01-01'
),
additional_orders as (
	select o.customer_id
	from Orders o
	inner join first_orders f
	on o.customer_id = f.customer_id
	where o.order_date > f.first_order_date
	and o.order_date <= f.first_order_date + interval '30 days'
)
select distinct c.customer_name
from additional_orders ao
inner join Customers c
on ao.customer_id = c.customer_id
```
3. Write a self-join query to retrieve all customers who have the same order amount for at least two different orders.
```sql
select o1.customer_id, o1.order_id, o1.amount
from Orders o1
join Orders o2
on o1.customer_id = o2.customer_id
and o1.order_id <> o2.order_id
where o1.amount = o2.amount
```

);
```
2. Retrieve the names of the products whose price is above the average price.
```sql

	from Sales
	where sale_date >= '2023-01-01' and sale_date < '2024-01-01'
	group by product_id, to_char(sale_date,'YYYY-MM')
	having count(sale_id) = 1
)
select p.product_name
